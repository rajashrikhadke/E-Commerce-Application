# E-Commerce-Application
The basic objective of this project is to develop an E-commerce-based application that allows users to buy products online. The system will store the product details such as ID, description, name, price, and quantity in a database. Users can view the product list in a sorted order, add products to the cart, purchase items, view their cart, and check out. The system will calculate the bill, display the amount to the end-user, and generate a bill. The application has three types of roles: User, Guest, and Admin, and each role has specific operations that they can perform. The system is designed to follow object-oriented programming concepts, use JDBC for database connectivity, and ensure that all input is validated and exceptions are handled.
